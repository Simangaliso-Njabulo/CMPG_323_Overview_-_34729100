# CMPG_323_Overview_-_34729100

This project will make use of 5 repositories, an overview repo which is created as part of project 1, and 4 other repositories for each of the other projects that remain. The other 4 repositories will be linked to the overview repo. These repositories will keep track of all activities happening in their respective projects and link that back to the overview repo. The diagram below depicts all the repositories and their relation to one another.

## Branching Strategy
The github branching strategy will be utelized for all of the projects since I will be working on them individually. In each of the project repositories I will create a development branch and that branch will push directly to the main branch of that particular project. Since development is directly linked to the main there is no need for a hot fix branch.  

## Gitignore
I will utilize a gitingore for each of my respective project. In this gitignore file I will be storing all the file that I do not want github to keep track of. Application file will be store in this file because they are generate by code editors. Credentials will also be included in the gitignore because we donâ€™t want sensitive information to be public. The contents of the gitignore file will somewhat be the same for all projects.

## Storage of credentials and sensitive information

## Project 2 Notes: 
### 30/08/22
Today I will be creating my Azure database and connecting it to my API.

Late update - On Saturday 27/08/22 I made a local database and created a simple API to see how everything works. I also created a resource group on MS Azure and tried to create the database, but I ran into some problems. Unfortunately, I forgot to update my readme.

### 01/09/22
Things are looking good, I connected my Azure database to my API and created all my basic methods. 

### 05/09/22
On the 3rd and 4th of Sept I was completing my training hence no update was made to my read me. Today I'll be looking into Security within my API.
