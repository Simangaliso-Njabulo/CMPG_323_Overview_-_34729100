# CMPG_323_Overview_-_34729100

This project will make use of 5 repositories, an overview repo which is created as part of project 1, and 4 other repositories for each of the other projects that remain. The other 4 repositories will be linked to the overview repo. These repositories will keep track of all activities happening in their respective projects and link that back to the overview repo. The diagram below depicts all the repositories and their relation to one another.

## Branching Strategy
The github branching strategy will be utelized for all of the projects since I will be working on them individually. In each of the project repositories I will create a development branch and that branch will push directly to the main branch of that particular project. Since development is directly linked to the main there is no need for a hot fix branch.
